# Runefighter
A quickie game written in Python just to see if I could do it.

## Overview

I have never finished a game. I've written some great, lengthy prototypes that proved some aspect of gameplay or another, but I've never finished a game. That sucks. So here goes.

Finished, for my purposes, means:

  * Intro screens
  * Attract mode
  * Game play
  * A few distinct levels
  * High scores
  * Sounds
  * Music

This is your basic "spaceship floating around shooting things" game. There will be waves. There will be distinct enemies. And I will finish it.

I'll also spend some time documenting my architectural decisions here.

## The Future

Possible expansions once the minimum viable game is done:

  * Boss fights
  * Power ups
  * More complicated AI
